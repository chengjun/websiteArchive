## Research Interest

I have a passion for computational communication research. I primarily work on studying the human communication behaviors (e.g., information diffusion, collective attention, public discussion, online dating, and social movement) on social media, employing digital fingerprints in an unobtrusive way. For example, in my Ph.D dissertation, I analyze the network data of Digg, Weibo, and YouTube with threshold models. You can find the introduction to my work paper here. The other research projects include:


+ Time Series Analysis of US Election 2012: The Interplay among Tweets, Search Query, Media Coverage, and Opinion Poll (2012. Oct-Now)


+ Randomly Sampling Social Media Users (2012.10-Now). I wrote Python scripts to detect the users of Flickr and YouTube, based on which I crawled all photos uploaded by these Flickr users, and all the videos uploaded by the respective YouTube users. Survival analysis will be employed later to study the sustainability of social media users.


+ Retweeting Network within the Rich-Club of Sina Weibo (2012.03-Now). We have crawled the social graph and historical tweets of the  most influential Weibo users, and plan to analyze the communication network with ERGM and longitudinal network analysis (e.g., SIENA).


+ Review of Integrated-Marketing Communication (IMC) (2011.02- 2012.10)
+ Mobile Internet Use in China (2009.12-2010.06)
